{Module two: An Introduction to C# and .NET}
Introduction
  Need to install VS
Setup
  VS community
.NET
  .NET framework is part of VS installation
  Application on top of framework can utilize framework's interface for features
  .NET framework contains two main parts:

    1. Common Language Runtime (CLR)
      - execution environment for .NET (C#) application
      - manage app while it executes
      - tear down app after execution or unrecoverable error
      - Other services include:
        memory management:
          tracking memory use during execution
          ensure enough memory during execution
          claen up memory after execution
        free user from hardware details
        support multiple languages: C#, VB, F#, ...etc

    2. Framework Class Library (FCL)
      - user interact on day-to-day basis
      - contain reusable software for building application
        such as:
          regular expression
          reand and write data from DB
      - AKA Base Class Library (BCL): technically a subet of FCL
        works everywhere (used for this course)
      - user typically focus on some area like ASP.NET, but not all

The C# Language
  one of the languages for .NET
  influence from Java, C++ and JavaScript

Hello, World
  - When CLR starts a console app, it will automatically start to
    look for a program class with Main method and start execute code inside
  - C sharp compiler (csc) can be found in following directory
      C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319>
  - Compilation usually done via Visual Studio

The Compiler: csc.exe
  - Compile one or multiple files into single executable or library
  - Transforms C# code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), similar to Java bytecode
  - MSIL define instruction for CLR
  - CLR transform MSIL instructions (within EXE) into CPU instructions

Visual Studio
  - access command line argument at Main method with string[] args

Debugging
  - To pass in argument while debugging:
     Right-click on project
     Select "Properties"
     Select "Debug" setting on left panel
     Under "Start Options"
      Within "Command line arguments"
      Enter arguments for string args[] during debugging
      [Content entered will be used for command line argument(s) during debugging]

Are You Sleepy?
  Shift + Ctrl + B: Build
  Start class and method name with upper Cases

Summary
  C# is strongly typed & case sensitive language for .NET
  Visual Studio is an IDE for C# app of all types
