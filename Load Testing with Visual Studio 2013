Purpose of Performance Testing
  Identify capabilities of a application

  Possible objectives:
    Explore: what can we actually do?
    Verify: Can we handle the expected / specified load?
    Find limit: How many user can we actual handle at our comfortable maximum?
    Crush application:
      What is the behavior when crushed?
      Any privacy or security breach or unpredicted / unacceptable behavior?

  Performance Testing in a Nutshell
    1. Throw traffic at application
    2. Does it perform as expected?
    3. (If performance problems were found) Recreate any performance problems with performance test
    4. Fix performance problem
    5. Verify valid fix by repeating performance test

What Can You Load Test with Visual Studio 2013 (Ultimate)?
  - ASP.NET with HTML UI
    - Web Forms or MVC - this is the ideal target
  - SharePoint Apps
  - HTTP-based Apps
    - ASP.NET-based SOA Apps
    - Service-based apps with WebAPI or RestAPI
  - Coded UI Test
  - Anything call from a Visual Studio Unit Test

  Put Unit Test in a Load Test
    - Test anything that can be called from C# or VB.NET
    - Typically target Service-Oriented Applications (SOA)
      - WCF Services
      - Web API
      - REST
      - OData
    - DB as well
      - Queries
      - Stored Procedure

  Coded UI Test
    - more difficult with Non-HTML / non-XML app test
    - takes much more hardware

Developing Load Tests with Visual Studio 2013
  1. Create "Web Performance and Load Test Project"
  2. Use Web Performance Test (WPTs) to simulate HTTP traffic
    - in steps where user use apps
  3. Unit Tests against services or DB
  4. Load Test (How groups of users will use app)
    - User counts & user load pattern
    - Servers & Windows Performance Monitor Counters
      - Which server to hit with load?
      - Which Windows Performance Monitor Counters to monitor to verify performance?
  5. Run test locally or...
    Run test with Load Test Rig or...
    Run Test with Cloud-based Load Test
      - Losts of load is needed to test app
      - On-premise: Load Controller & Agents
      - Cloud: Visual Studio Online

  The development & execution life cycle
  1. Create Web Performance Tests & Unit Tests
    - Scenarios for test
    - Implemented with WPT or Unit Test
  2. Create Load Tests
    - Mix of scenarios
    - Mix of configurations
    - Defination of what should be monitored across server(s)
      - describes what the load is going to look like
  3. Run Tests
    - Exercise System Under Test (SUT)
      - run from VS 2013: generate load with workstation
      - run from load test rig
      - run from Visual Studio Online
    - Record run-time data
  4. Analyze
    - Examine data
    - Make changes as needed
    - Re-Test

Ways to Run Load Tests
  1. Use VS 2013 to generate load and monitor execution
  2. Use Load Test Rig that consisted of a load controller and many load agents
  3. Use Visual Studio Online Cloud-based Load Testing
    - best for public website / web services

Ultimate goal:
  Running load test using a load test rig or with cloud-based load testing

{Module two: Web Performance Test Basics}
Introduction
  Typical scenario: ASP.NET app with HTML-based UI
  Basics of Web Performance Tests (WPT)
  Organize WPT test suite
  Validation rule: validate what's on the screen
  Parameterization & Test Context
  Extraction rules: collect value from screen for use later

What Is a Web Performance Test?
  Test Type in VS 2013 Ultimate
  Exists within a Web Performance and Load Test project
  Collection of HTTP requests against the App
  Simulate user using (ASP.NET) Web App by play back Http requests
  Building blocks of load tests

Demo: Create a Web Performance Test
  remove unnecessary request recorded and keep application specific requests

How Do Web Performance Tests Work?
  No browser - onlly simulated HTTP traffic
  Series of steps
    generate web request
    web performance test simulate user

Test Organization
  Objective: turn web performance test into load test
    Plan ahead: how to diagnose performance problems
    Use the same way to organize performance test

  Web Tests = User Stories
    User stories formula:
      As a "X", I want to do "Y" so that I can achieve "Z"
      As a "X", I want to do "Y" and "Z"
  Guide test suite organization for diagnose problems in load test

WPT needs to be granular enough - so the slow part can be identify
Each WPT should do 1 thing
  Good naming and organization
    - LogInWithUsernamePassword
    - SearchByLastName
    - CreateNewUser
    - PlaceOrderWithPayPal
    - Logout
  A slow test indicate target for optimization

Demo: Readability with Comments
  Right click on a request to add comment

Validation Rules
  Check if Web App is functional by:
    Check values of HTTP response
    Can be scoped to:
      - individual request / test
      - all requests / tests

Demo: Add Validation Rules

Parameterization & Test Context
  Parameterization
    Minimize hard coded values
    {{variable_name}} syntax within WPT
      Plugin values as needed:
        Data-Driven Web Test
        Data-Driven Load Test
      Pull values from data source
  Parameterize web server name
