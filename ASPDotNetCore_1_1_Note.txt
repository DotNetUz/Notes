Middleware
middleware componeents handle HTTP requests
each component has a limited and specific role
many components are required for an app to work correctly 

Ex.
POST to /reviews
    Logger Middleware Component 
    Authorizer Middle Component 
    Router Middleware Component
Response with HTTP 200 OK
    Router Middleware Component
    Authorizer Middle Component
    Logger Middleware Component 

Logger logs info about every HTTP request
Logger sees header, query string, cookies and access tokens, 
and it can also change info about it, and/or stop processing request
but most likely to log info and pass along to the next component

middleware is a series of components executed in order
