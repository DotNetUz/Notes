Introduction to Programming
  You don't know JS: up & going
  Source code is not really for computer - multiple source codes can be identical computer instruction
  Source code is for developer to read and understand what the computer is doing
  Avoid unfounded assumptions based on memory - aim for sensible code

  Syntax + Grammer (rules) = how to write JS programs as "statements"

Statements
  Ex. a = b * 2; // In JS, statements ends with semicolon
  2 is a literal value 
  * is the muliplication operator 
  A word without special meaning (keyword) is a variable, an identifier - like a or b
  left side of assignment (=) is computed and assigned to the left hand side

Expressions
  Statements are composed of phrases, known as expressions
  For ex. in a = ((b) * (2));
  a is an expression
  b is an expression
  2 is an expression
  b * 2 is an expression
  a = b * 2 is an assignment expression and a statement 

  a = b * 2 + foo(c * 3);
  ((a) = (((b) * (2)) + ((foo)((c) * (3))));
  adding parentheses can improve readability 
  operation order typically goes from left to right, so b * 2 before foo
  except when it is overridden by operator precedence or associativity  

  In JS, 2, 2.0 are the same value
