ASP.NET Core: The Big Picture
  ASP.NET Core:
    open-source & cross platform framework for building modern cloud-based internet connected applications
    re-design from ground up
    granular set of NuGet packages
    smaller application service area
      tighter security
      reduced servicing
      improved performance

  ASP.NET Core runs on:
    Full .NET Framework: target all dependencies
    .NET Core:
      small footprint
      performance improvement
      cross-platform

Demo: Downloading and Installing .NET Core

Demo: Starting a New ASP.NET Core Project
  Under solution "Cityinfo.API":
    Program.cs:
      Starting point of application
        w/ "public static void Main(string[] args)"
        -> ASP.NET Core is a console application (that calls into ASP.NET specific libraries)

      public static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var host = new WebHostBuilder()
                .UseKestrel()
                .UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
                .UseIISIntegration()
                .UseStartup<Startup>()
                .UseApplicationInsights()
                .Build();
            host.Run();
        }
      WebHostBuilder(): Host application
      UseKestrel(): Provides default Web Server
      ASP.Net Core is completely decoupled from web server environment
      ASP.Net Core is shipped with two different Http servers:
        WebListener: windows-only seb server
        Kestrel (default): cross-platform web server
      UseIISIntegration():
        Since IIS Express is default host for Visual Studio
        IIS Express functions as reverse proxy server for Kestrel
        Self hosting with IIS Express is possible, but IIS is much nicer
      UseContentRoot(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory()):
        UseContentRoot() specifies content root directory used by web host
        content root:
          base path to any content used by any application (like views and web content)
          default: same as app base path for the executable hosting the app
        content root is NOT webroot (wwwroot)
      UseStartup<Startup>():
        specifies startup type used by web host
      Build():
        build IWebHost instance to host our web app
      Run():
        runs web app; blocks the calling thread until host shuts down

    Startup.cs: entry point of application

      public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services):
        an optional method
        for registering that are NOT registered automatically
        * Add services to the container & configure services *
      container: for dependency Injection
      service: component intended for common consumption in an application
        example:
          (framework Services) identity, MVC, EF Core services
          (application services - application specific) like one for sending email
          (built-in services)
            like ApplicationBuilder or Logger - there are NO coding in ConfigureServices
            built-in services are available for injection

      Injection via Configure method:
        example: public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IHostingEnvironment env, ILoggerFactory loggerFactory)
        with Instance of
          IApplicationBuilder
          IHostingEnvironment
          ILoggerFactory
        provided by the container

        Called after ConfigureServices()
        Uses services configured and registered in ConfigureServices()
        Specify how app will respond to individual HTTP requests, such as MVC

The ASP.NET Core Request Pipeline and Middleware
  Request pipeline:
    code logic that handles requests and returns response
    configure pipeline by adding middleware(s)
    example:
      diagnostics middleware
      authentication middleware
      MVC

  Each middleware determines to pass request on to the next component in pipeline or NOT
  Order to add middleware matters
  example:
    authentication middleware finds unauthorized request and returns unauthorized response without passing to the next middleware
    Therefore, authentication middleware needs to be added

Demo: Configuring the ASP.NET Request Pipeline
  Add developer exception page middleware to request pipeline
    [Within Configure method]
    app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage()
    This is part of microsoft.aspnet.core.diagnostics assembly
    Most middlewares are in separate assemblies

  Add following code to trigger exception
    app.Run( (context) =>
    {
      throw new Exception("Example exception");
    });

  Add ExceptionHandler to HTTP request pipeline when environment is not development
    if (env.IsDevelopment())
      {
        app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage();
      }
      else {
        app.UseExceptionHandler();
      }

  Change environment from "Development" to "Production"
  Project Properties | Debug |
    For Environment variable:
      Change value of ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT to "Production" from "Development"

Summary

{Module 3: Creating the API and Returning Resources}
Coming Up
  Add middleware to Web API, such as ASP.NET Core Middleware
  Return resources (data) from Web API
  Interact with Web API by sending HTTP request
  Configure response

Middleware for Building an API
  Need to:
    Add middleware to HTTP request pipeline in Configure method
    Add framework services to container in ConfigureServices method

  Previously (Before Core)
    ASP.NET Web API: Http services
    ASP.NET MVC: Client-facing web application

  Now (only):
    ASP.NET Core MVC

Clarifying the MVC Pattern
  MVC = Model-View-Controllers
    Architecture software pattern for implementing UI
    Encourage loose coupling, separation of concerns, testability, reuse
    Not the FULL application architecture

    A typical N-tier architecture: presentation layer, business layer, data access layer
    also likely a service layer in-between

    MVC is used as presentation layer

  Model:
    handles the logic of application data like retrive or store data
    If MVC pattern is only used at the top level of architecture, the model does not contain any logic
    - another component handles this, such as business layer
    Alternatively, a View Model contains code to retrive or store data, used as model

  View:
    handles the display of data, like HTML
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
    depends on Model
  
  Controller:
    handles interaction between Model and View
    handles user input
    depends on Model & View
    chooses View to display to user
    provide the View with any Model data the View required

  In terms of API:
    View represents data or resources (JSON)
    Consumer of API is typically another application
    Request send by consumer of API will trigger Controller
    Controller takes user inputs (like query string parameters) to component responsible of business or data logic 
    Controller returns a model to data or resources like JSON (View)

Demo: Adding the ASP.NET Core MVC Middleware
  Under Startup.cs / ConfigureServices()
    Add services.AddMvc();
      AddMvc() is not recognized
      Add reference: Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc

  Under Startup.cs / Configure()
    Add app.UseMvc();
    below exception handling code

  Run project with IIS Express
    return error 404

  Next: Add controller to return resources (data)
