Ch 1 Values, Types, and Operators
    number 13 in bits => 
        1 1 0 1 => 
        1 * 2^3 + 1 * 2^2 + 0 * 2^1 + 1 * 2^0 =
        8 + 4 + 1 = 13   
    Values: chunks of bits that represnt pieces of information
        6 basic types of value:
            numbers, strings, Boolean, object, functions and undefined values
    Numbers
        A single number is stored in 64 bits - which can represnt 2^64 different numbers 
        Overflow: a number does NOT fit into given amount of bits
        Represent nonwhole number: extra bit to store position of decimal point
        Negative number: one bit for sign of number
        Actual whole number (integer) can be precisely stored: 9 quadrillion 15 zeros   
        Scientific notation by "e", like 2.998e8 => 299,800,000
        Precision: many number lose precision with only 64 bit bits available 
        Treat fractional digits as approximation NOT precise number
        Arithmetic operator precedence: 
            (), 
            %, *, /
            +, -
        Special numbers:
            Infinity & -Infinity: positive and negative infinity 
                Infinity - 1 is still infinity
                Infinity computation is NOT mathmatically solid 
            NaN: a value of number type, but Not-a-Number (NaN)
                Infinity - Infinity = NaN
                0 / 0 = NaN
    Strings
        string is written by enclosing content in single / double quotes
        escaping character with backslash (\)
            ex. \" a quote preceed by backslash will be part of string, instead of end it
                \n newline, \t tab 
        concatenates strings with + operator 
                
    Unary operators operates on one value
        "typeof" operator:
            typeof 3.5; // => "number"
        binary operator takes two values 
        minus operator can be both unary and binary operator 
    
    Boolean values: true & false
        Comparisons as a way to produce Boolean value
        Ex. 3 > 2; // => true
        Uppercase is always "LESS" than Lowercase
        string Comparison is based on Unicode standard (as a sequence of numbers)  
            - Goes over from left to right, one character at a time
        NaN: The only value in JavaScript that does not equal to itself (nonsensical computation)

    Undefined values 
    Automatic type conversion
