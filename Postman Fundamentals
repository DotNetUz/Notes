Postman Fundamentals
Module 1: Course Overview
  Making API request using different Environments
  Automated testing an API
  Scripting API workflows 
  Documenting an API

  Course goal: Maximize interactions w/ any APi

Module 2: Setting the Stage
  Setting the Stage
    Using Postman to interact w/ API
    API reach both front end and back end 
    
    Roles:
      App Dev - does not use API directly 
        - mock data when API is not quite ready yet
        - setup application without clicking through UI or enter data
      API dev - design & implement API
        - use Postman to test and document API
    
    Postman simplifies working with APIs

  Getting Started: Postman
    Use Postman to hit real API and get real data
    Install Postman via Chrome App store
      chrome://apps
      select webstore application
      search for Postman
      intsall Postman as Chrome application
      pro: install Postman on Mac & PC & Linux
    
    Install Postman as a stand alone application
      Load getpostman.com
      Download accordingly 

  Getting Started: API
    Get project to run locally
      Install Git, Node.js, PostgresSQL 
      Get project from https://github.com/taylonr/postman
      
  The Path Ahead
    Postman Basics: UI walk through - basic requests and API calls
    Testing Requests: Use Postman to Test API
    Collections: 
      Group similar API calls
      Combine collections and testing to script application
    Mock server: to return request
      For prototyping or working ahead of API development to prevent block
    Documentations:
      Postman helps w/ documentation on how API works
