{Module 2: JavaScript Basics}
Introduction
  Module Overview
    script tag: <script>
      HTML5 tag that let us include JS within web Pages
    Variables and Types
    Functions
    Conditionals
    Loops
    JS Usage: comments, end of line character, semicolon and other Topics

JavaScript in Web Pages
  <script>:
    embeded JS within web page or point to JS file
    any code embeded within a script tage in HTML will execute immedately

  src attribute (on script tage): specify which JS file to load
  defer attribute delays the loading of a file
  <no script>: contains markup to display when JS is turned off or browser cannot display JS

  Q & A:
    <script> tage can be placed and executed in both <head> and <body> section of a web page
  
  Q & A:
    reference external JS file with page
    File: js/app.js
      console.log("in app.js");
    File: index.html
      <body>
        <script src="js/app.js"></script>
      </body>
  
  Q&A:
    Using <script> tag with src attribute, only JS code in referenced file will be executed.
    Code within <script> tag will be ignored

Variables
  Fundamentals & how it is used
  undefined (keyword) as its own data type
  Primitive Types
  Object and function Types

  variable as string (in double quote), int  
  var orderId = "ORD-9001";
  orderId = 1201;
  
  variable (var) in JavaScript is dynamically typed & the type is definite 
  However, type can be changed thoughout execution

  undefined:
    When a variable is not initialized, it is always set to "undefined" -> typeof "undefined"
  
  'use strict'; // enter strict mode - JavaScript will not create global variable implicitly when var is not used
  orderId = 9001;
  console.log(orderId);
    VM103:2 Uncaught ReferenceError: orderId is not defined
      at <anonymous>:2:9

  var orderId = 9001;
  console.log(typeof orderId);
  output: number

  number is one of the primitive datatype with JavaScript
  both integer and floating point number are specified by the type "number"

  var orderId = "ORD-9001";
  console.log(typeof orderId);
  output: string

  string is another primitive datatype

  var isActive = true;
  console.log(typeof isActive);
  output: boolean

  boolean is another primitive datatype

  JSON object and array are both typeof "object"
    var order = {
    orderId: 9001,
    isActive: true
    };
    console.log(typeof order);
    output: object

  null is of type "object"
  var order = null;
  console.log(typeof order);
  output: object

  function cancelOrder(orderId) {};
  console.log(typeof cancelOrder);
  output: function

  function is another primitive datatype
