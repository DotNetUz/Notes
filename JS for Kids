Part I: Fundamentals
Chapter 1: What Is JavaScript?
    The Structure of a JavaScript Program
        In browser console: Add new lines by pressing shift-enter at the end of each line
    Syntax: rules to combine symbol and words to create programs
    Comments: 
        - Start with two forward lashes (//)
        - in between /* and */
    
Chapter 2: Data Types and Variables
    Data: info stored in program
    Basic data types: numbers, strings and booleans
    ";" marks end of statement
    Variable:
        variable: hold information, new assignment replace the old information  
        Create variable (with keyword var) or initialize variable does not return a value 
            => JS interpreter prints "undefined"
        Assign value to an existing variable and interpreter returns the value assigned and prints it
        Expression can be made from variable and interpreter returns the value of evaluation 
        Ex. 
            var x = 8, y = 2;
            x/y; // => 4
    Naming Variable - camel case:
        - numberOfCandies (Capitalize 1st character)
        - NumberOfCandies (Lower case 1st character)
    Creating New Variables Using Math:
        Ex. Seconds in an hour
            var secondsInAMinute = 60;
            var minutesInAnHour = 60;
            var secondsinAnHour = secondsInAMinute * minutesInAnHour;
            secondsinAnHour; // => 3600  
    Incrementing and Decrementing with ++ or -- operator 
        Increment = increase by 1
        Decrement = decrease by 1
        Pre-Increment / Pre-Decrement (++i or --i) return the value AFTER increment / decrement
        Post-Increment / Post-Decrement (i++ or i--) return the value BEFORE increment / decrement
        Ex.
            var x = 0, y = 0;
            console.log(x++); // => 1
            console.log(++y); // => 0
    += (plus-equals) and â€“= (minus-equals)    
    Ex. 
        X += 3; // x = x + 3;
        y -= 4; // y = y - 4;
        x *= 3; // x = x * 3;
        y /= 2; // y = y / 2;
