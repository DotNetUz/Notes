Module 3: Shaping Data in a Query with SELECT
  Introduction
    Course objective: 
      Combine and filter data for both presentation and data analytics
        include, Data manipulation via SELECT command 
    
    Four primary purpose of SQL Statement (CRUD)
    Create
      INSERT INTO table
    READ 
      SELECT field FROM table
    UPDATE
      UPDATE table SET field
    DELETE 
      DELETE FROM table 

    Data Manipulation Language (DML)
      Concatenation
      CAST() & CONVERT()
      Formatting Data
        - Dates
        - Strings
        - Numbers
      NULL
      Extrapulate information from customer data: 
        How long does it take to get customer's order?
        How many years has an EE worked
      Query Logic Methods:
        Case, WHEN, IF ELSE
      SQL Error handling 

  Anatomy of the Select Statement
    Syntax 
      The rules that state how and in which order, words and symbols are used in a computer language 
    Query
      The question - what is asked?
    Result set
      The answer - the data returned from the query
    SELECT query consisted of 4 elements:
      SELECT -  always required
      GROUP BY - required in some cases
      FROM - specify which table or DB the data should be retrived from 

      SELECT expressions (WHAT?)
      FROM tables (WHERE?)
      GROUP BY fields(SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX) (aggregation)
      HAVING or WHERE conditions (Filtered on?) (Optional)
      ORDER BY Asc or Desc (Organized How?) (Optional)

  Cast() & Convert()
  Formatting and Calculating Dates
