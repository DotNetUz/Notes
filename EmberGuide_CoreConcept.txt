Router and Route Handler
URL defines mode of operation:
    CRUD on item x?
URL is set by:
    Initial page load
    Manual edit
    Click link or button
    Other event in app

Router maps URL to a Route Handler

Route Handler...
    renders a template
    or, loads model that's then available to the template

Template organize HTML layout with Handlebars template 
    {{}} holds:
        properties
        helpers 
        components 

Model represents persistent state 
    typically saved on web server, 
    but also anywhere else, like browser's local storage 

Component controls how user interface behave 
    Component = handlebars template + source file in JS

Hooks are methods called automatically in app
    Ex.
        Component Lifecycle Hooks: run code at component initial render, re-render or destroyed  
            willRender() hooks get called before each time a component renders
        Route Hooks: model() load model on route
