Module 1: Introduction
  Transact-SQL / T-SQL
    Create a table, work w/ columns and types 
    Changing data w/ INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE 
    Reading Data w/ SELECT
    Querying multiple tables w/ JOIN
    Arranging data w/ TOP, ORDER BY, OFFSET
    Analysis w/ Aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc)
    Many to Many, Self-referencing Relationships
    Working w/ Strings and Dates
    SQL Server Express 2017 and SQL Server Management Studio is used for this note
    Install and connect to SQL Server locally 
    In SQL Server Management Studio, under local server, R-click on "Databases" to create new DB

Module 2: Working with Tables
  Creating / Droping a Table
    Select DB to add table under
      SQL: 
        create table Users(
          email varchar(50)
        );
      F5 / "Execute" to run this
      Message: Commands completed successfully.

      To see changes made by SQL query in UI, R-click under "Tables" to "Refresh" under Object Explorer 
      R-click "dbo.Users" and expend "Columns" to see "email (varchar(50), null)"

    To remove this table: 
      SQL: drop table Users;

  Primary Keys: Integer
    Primary Keys uniquely identify each row in a table - relational theory
    Create a table w/ primary keys
      SQL:
        create table Users(
          Id integer primary key
        );
      Columns: Id(PK, int, not null) with a key icon

      R-click "dbo.Users" and [Edit Top 200 Rows] and enter 1 for Id fields twice 
        - "Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint" error
        - Primary Keys are unique

  Primary Keys: GUID
    Need to identify data outside of DB - an Enterprise-wide Id that is always unique in any settings, GUID 
    SQL:
      create table Users(
        Id uniqueidentifier primary key
      );
    Columns: Id(PK, uniqueidentifier, not null)
    in program, GUID can be generated via entity framework 
    
  Primary Keys: Auto-incrementing
