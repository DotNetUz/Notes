Chapter One: Primitive and Reference Types 
    Lack of classes -> 
    Lack of packages (class grouping) -> 
    High degrees freedom of organization

    Almost all data in JavaScript is an object OR is accessed via objects 
    Functions are represented as objects too - first class Functions

    Objects can be created anytime
    Object properties can be added or removed anytime

    Two primary JavaScript data types:
    1. primitive types
    2. reference types

  What are Types:
    Primitive types: stored as simple data types
    Reference types: stored as objects (references to location in memory)

    Primitive types can be treated like reference types
