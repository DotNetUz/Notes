  Module Introduction
    Terminology
    Architectural Overview
    Tools

  What Is T-SQL?
    Standardized by ANSI and ISO
    1st edition published in 1986, latest in 2019
    Each vandor uses subset of and extensions to ANSI SQL standard 
    T-SQL = Transact SQL 
      used by Microsoft SQL Server and Sybase
    
    MS SQL Server = relational DB management system (RDBMS)
    Other types of Database Management System (DBMS) include:
      Hierarchal
      Object-oriented 
      Document stores 
      Key value stores
      Graph database

    Relational model  
      a data modeling paradigm based on set theory and first order predicate logic

    What is DB? Simon Allardice's 'Databases - executive briefing'

  A Little SQL Server Architecture
    SQL Server => SQL Server Services
      Core SQL DB Engine
      Macine learning 
      Integration Analysis 
      Reporting 
      Replication
      Others 

    Core SQL DB Engine can be installed on 
      Windows / Linux OS
      Docker container

    Most Cloud provider offer SQL Server as a managed cloud product 
    MS Azure has Azure SQL DB, a SQL Server DB in a platform as a Service 

    SQL Server is 
      a multi-user server
      communicated via TCP / IP port

    User and application servers use API to send queries to server and receive results from network

    Two authentication methods for users and application clients
      SQL Authentication - login credential stored internally 
      Windows Authentication - Active Directory for single sign-on scenario

    SQL Server Object Hierarchy
      OS contains 1 or more ...
      SQL Server Instance that contains 1 or more ...
      Database that contains 1 or more ...
      Schema that contains ...
      Object(s) like
        Table
        View
        Store Procedure
        others    

    Fully Qualified Object Names
      Can access every object
      Consist of 4 parts: [Instance].[Database].[Schema].Object

    Omit 
      Instance - use current instance connection
      Database - use current session's DB context
      Schema   - use dbo (database owner) or explicit default schema

  Tools
    SQL Server Instance: azure sql database also available  
    Client IDE: SSMS or Azure Data Studio
    Online tools - No persist data:

Module 3 Our First SELECT
  Module Introduction
    Query execution order
    Terminology 
      Sets
      Expressions
      Operators
      Functions
      Aliases
      Data types
    SELECT without FROM
  What Is a SQL Query?
    Complete list of SQL clause (caluse = part of a sentence that contains a verb):
      (5) SELECT          - List of expressions to return
      (1) FROM            - Source data set, the ONLY data available for all following clauses 
      (2) WHERE           - Filter rows with predicate (a Boolean function that can return True or False)  
      (3) GROUP BY        - Rows combined into groups based on grouping expression
      (4) HAVING          - Filter whole groups instead of rows
      (6) ORDER BY        - Sort for presentation order
      (7) OFFSET - FETCH  - page specification; limit numbers of rows that will be returned 

  More Terminology
    Set - a collection of unique elements with No order (neither for Row, nor for Column); also an element on its own
    Relation - how a subset of elements related to each other which form a meaningful unit (Table)
    Tuples - a finite ordered list of elements of a relation; AKA Rows 
    Rows - unique and have NO order 
    Key - attribute(s) that ensure uniqueness of Rows, like name, ISBN or order number
    Tuple - attribute, known as Column in SQL 
    Alias 
      - name to hold datasets or individual expressions
      - by default Alias is an object's name, like "Employees" table
      - any expression involve more than just base column lose column alias (AS)

    SQL is a Stringly Typed language = every expression in SQL has a specific data type
      Numeric
      String
      Binary
      Temporal

      Special Data Types
        Hierarchy
        Spatial
        Document (XML / JSON)
