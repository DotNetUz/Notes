The Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol
  Communication Protocol Terms
    Unix and Linux based remote communication protocol 
    Module covers OpenSSH
    
    Communication protocol 
      Accepted rules that establish the synchronization methodology
      and syntax that parties to a communication session
      will use to govern their exchanges

    Open System Interconnection (OSI) Model
      7 layers:
        Layer 7: Application
          Ex. Image load by browser
        Layer 6: Presentation
          Ex. Image is converted into readable format where data transformation 
          like encryption and media file processing 
        Layer 5: Session
          Ex. Constant connection w/ remote web server via HTTP protocol
          SSH and Telnet also operate on layer 5 
          [A phone call without conversation]
        Layer 4: Transport
          Ex. Data transfer on top of session, on transport layer
          TCP protocol
        Layer 3: Network
          Ex. Infrastructure made up of routers or IPv4 or ICMP protocol
              that makes adress assignment, routng b/t network, control moving network traffic  
              - Routing request of URL from browser to server's host 
        Data / Data Link
          Take care transmission of data frames
          Handle acknowledagements of reception
          Data Frame:
            
        Physical

      Layer 1 to 3 are Media layer - provide actual connectivity 
      Layer 4 to 7 are Host layers
