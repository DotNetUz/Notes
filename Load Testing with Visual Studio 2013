Purpose of Performance Testing
  Identify capabilities of a application

  Possible objectives:
    Explore: what can we actually do?
    Verify: Can we handle the expected / specified load?
    Find limit: How many user can we actual handle at our comfortable maximum?
    Crush application:
      What is the behavior when crushed?
      Any privacy or security breach or unpredicted / unacceptable behavior?

  Performance Testing in a Nutshell
    1. Throw traffic at application
    2. Does it perform as expected?
    3. (If performance problems were found) Recreate any performance problems with performance test
    4. Fix performance problem
    5. Verify valid fix by repeating performance test

What Can You Load Test with Visual Studio 2013 (Ultimate)?
  - ASP.NET with HTML UI
    - Web Forms or MVC - this is the ideal target
  - SharePoint Apps
  - HTTP-based Apps
    - ASP.NET-based SOA Apps
    - Service-based apps with WebAPI or RestAPI
  - Coded UI Test
  - Anything call from a Visual Studio Unit Test

  Put Unit Test in a Load Test
    - Test anything that can be called from C# or VB.NET
    - Typically target Service-Oriented Applications (SOA)
      - WCF Services
      - Web API
      - REST
      - OData
    - DB as well
      - Queries
      - Stored Procedure

  Coded UI Test
    - more difficult with Non-HTML / non-XML app test
    - takes much more hardware

Developing Load Tests with Visual Studio 2013
  1. Create "Web Performance and Load Test Project"
  2. Use Web Performance Test (WPTs) to simulate HTTP traffic
    - in steps where user use apps
  3. Unit Tests against services or DB
  4. Load Test (How groups of users will use app)
    - User counts & user load pattern
    - Servers & Windows Performance Monitor Counters
      - Which server to hit with load?
      - Which Windows Performance Monitor Counters to monitor to verify performance?
  5. Run test locally or...
    Run test with Load Test Rig or...
    Run Test with Cloud-based Load Test
      - Losts of load is needed to test app
      - On-premise: Load Controller & Agents
      - Cloud: Visual Studio Online

  The development & execution life cycle
  1. Create Web Performance Tests & Unit Tests
    - Scenarios for test
    - Implemented with WPT or Unit Test
  2. Create Load Tests
    - Mix of scenarios
    - Mix of configurations
    - Defination of what should be monitored across server(s)
      - describes what the load is going to look like
  3. Run Tests
    - Exercise System Under Test (SUT)
      - run from VS 2013: generate load with workstation
      - run from load test rig
      - run from Visual Studio Online
    - Record run-time data
  4. Analyze
    - Examine data
    - Make changes as needed
    - Re-Test

Ways to Run Load Tests
  1. Use VS 2013 to generate load and monitor execution
  2. Use Load Test Rig that consisted of a load controller and many load agents
  3. Use Visual Studio Online Cloud-based Load Testing
    - best for public website / web services

Ultimate goal:
  Running load test using a load test rig or with cloud-based load testing

{Module two: Web Performance Test Basics}
Introduction
  Typical scenario: ASP.NET app with HTML-based UI
  Basics of Web Performance Tests (WPT)
  Organize WPT test suite
  Validation rule: validate what's on the screen
  Parameterization & Test Context
  Extraction rules: collect value from screen for use later

What Is a Web Performance Test?
  Test Type in VS 2013 Ultimate
  Exists within a Web Performance and Load Test project
  Collection of HTTP requests against the App
  Simulate user using (ASP.NET) Web App by play back Http requests
  Building blocks of load tests

Demo: Create a Web Performance Test
  remove unnecessary request recorded and keep application specific requests

How Do Web Performance Tests Work?
  No browser - onlly simulated HTTP traffic
  Series of steps
    generate web request
    web performance test simulate user

Test Organization
  Objective: turn web performance test into load test
    Plan ahead: how to diagnose performance problems
    Use the same way to organize performance test

  Web Tests = User Stories
    User stories formula:
      As a "X", I want to do "Y" so that I can achieve "Z"
      As a "X", I want to do "Y" and "Z"
  Guide test suite organization for diagnose problems in load test

WPT needs to be granular enough - so the slow part can be identify
Each WPT should do 1 thing
  Good naming and organization
    - LogInWithUsernamePassword
    - SearchByLastName
    - CreateNewUser
    - PlaceOrderWithPayPal
    - Logout
  A slow test indicate target for optimization

Demo: Readability with Comments
  Right click on a request to add comment

Validation Rules
  Check if Web App is functional by:
    Check values of HTTP response
    Can be scoped to:
      - individual request / test
      - all requests / tests

Demo: Add Validation Rules

Parameterization & Test Context
  Parameterization
    Minimize hard coded values
    {{variable_name}} syntax within WPT
      Plugin values as needed:
        Data-Driven Web Test
        Data-Driven Load Test
      Pull values from data source
  Parameterize web server Adresses
    - Avoid hard coded server addresses
    - Enable different values for different environments
      - Values specified in Load Tests override values in WPT

  Parameterization via:
    - data source
    - Test Context

  Test Context: local to web performance test
    Name value pairs, like Dictionary<string, string>
    Load Test variables > Performance Test variable

Extraction Rules: use computed value (off screen) then use it later
  - Locates a value in the text of web page response
  - Store it in Test Context
  - Then value can be used in request later
  - Also allow modification of test context values dynamically (simulate users)

Demo: Extraction Rules
  For JSON response, to extract a specific value:
    Add Extraction Rule (to extract value for facilityName)
      Extract Text
        Start With: "facilityName":"
        End With: "

{Module three: Validation & Extraction Rules}
Introduction
  Validation rules: Check if system is still working 
  Extraction rules: Obtain values off screen during run-time 
  Out-of-box vs. Custom options for both 

Validation Rules Overview
  Out-of-box Validation Rules
    Check value of HTTP response
    Scope to single request or all requests in web performance test
  3 types:
    Content Validation Rule
    Performance Validation Rule
    SharePoint Validation Rule 

Content Validation Rules
  6 types:
    Form Field 
    Find Text
    Required Tag
    Selection Option
    Tag Inner Text
    Required Attribute Value 
  
    Form Field:  
      Varifies a field value within a HTML <form>
      A field can be located by name, if value matches expected value, the validation rule passes 
      Properties 
        Form Field Name
        Expected Value
       
    Find Text:
      Searches for text in response or with regular expression 
      Properties
        Find Text
        Ignore Case
        Use Regular Expression
        Pass/Faile if text is found 

    Required Tag:
      Verifies HTML tag exists in response with minimum times of occurrences
      Properties
        Required Tag Name 
        Min. number of expected occurrences
      
    Selected Option
      Test a <select> control in HTML
      Properties
        Select Tag Name - locate the tag to validate 
        Expected Selected Option 
        Index - locate certain instances of tag on the form 
        Ignore case - sets case sensitivity (on or off)
    
    Tag Inner Text
      Validates contents of an HTML tag 
      Properties:
        Tag Name 
        Attribute Name 
        Attribute Value 
        Expected Inner Text 
        Remove Tags in Inner Text 
        Has Closing Tag 
        Collapse Extra White Space 
        Index
        Ignore Case   
        Ex.
          <div id="my-div-tag">
            Is this text the 
            value that we expect? 
          </div>
        Tag Name = div
        Attribute Name = id
        Attribute Value = my-div-tag
        Expected Inner Text = Is this text the value that we expect? 
        Collapse Extra White Space = true
        Ignore Case = true

    Required Attribute Value
      Search by tag name, attribute name and attribute value 
      Such as, tag name + "id" + id value
      Properties to locate tag
        Tag Name 
        Match Attribute Name 
        Match Attribute Value  
      Properties to validate found tag      
        Attribute Name
        Expected Value
        Ignore Case

Performance Validation Rules
  3 types:
    Response Time Goal
