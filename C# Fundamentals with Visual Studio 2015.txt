{Module two: An Introduction to C# and .NET}
Introduction
  Need to install VS
Setup
  VS community
.NET
  .NET framework is part of VS installation
  Application on top of framework can utilize framework's interface for features
  .NET framework contains two main parts:

    1. Common Language Runtime (CLR)
      - execution environment for .NET (C#) application
      - manage app while it executes
      - tear down app after execution or unrecoverable error
      - Other services include:
        memory management:
          tracking memory use during execution
          ensure enough memory during execution
          claen up memory after execution
        free user from hardware details
        support multiple languages: C#, VB, F#, ...etc

    2. Framework Class Library (FCL)
      - user interact on day-to-day basis
      - contain reusable software for building application
        such as:
          regular expression
          reand and write data from DB
      - AKA Base Class Library (BCL): technically a subet of FCL
        works everywhere (used for this course)
      - user typically focus on some area like ASP.NET, but not all

The C# Language
  one of the languages for .NET
  influence from Java, C++ and JavaScript

Hello, World
  - When CLR starts a console app, it will automatically start to
    look for a program class with Main method and start execute code inside
  - C sharp compiler (csc) can be found in following directory
      C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319>
  - Compilation usually done via Visual Studio

The Compiler: csc.exe
  - Compile one or multiple files into single executable or library
  - Transforms C# code into Microsoft Intermediate Language (MSIL), similar to Java bytecode
  - MSIL define instruction for CLR
  - CLR transform MSIL instructions (within EXE) into CPU instructions

Visual Studio
  - access command line argument at Main method with string[] args

Debugging
  - To pass in argument while debugging:
     Right-click on project
     Select "Properties"
     Select "Debug" setting on left panel
     Under "Start Options"
      Within "Command line arguments"
      Enter arguments for string args[] during debugging
      [Content entered will be used for command line argument(s) during debugging]

Are You Sleepy?
  Shift + Ctrl + B: Build
  Start class and method name with upper Cases

Summary
  C# is strongly typed & case sensitive language for .NET
  Visual Studio is an IDE for C# app of all types

{Module three: Classes and Objects}
Introduction
  Relationship b/t classes and objects

The Grade Book
  Use class to create abstraction for different nouns to work with
    - a person, a place, a thin, an idea
  Class Member Define:
    1. State
    2. Behavior (methods)

Classes and Objects
  float is single precision
  double is double precision
  a decimal number is by default a double percision floating point number
    - no implicit conversion from float to double
  To assign value to a float variable, attach f at end of decimal number:
    float d = 91.5f;

Constructors
  Every class has constructor implicitly
  ctor: code snippet for constructor

Classes and Variables
  garbage: object no longer being used
  CLR clean garbage objects up and free up memory periodically

Reference Types
  Wehn define a class, a reference type is created
  Variable does not hold class object,
  it holds pointer to the object in memory,
  which is a memory address

Access Modifiers
  Encapsulation: enclosing or hiding details
    public: can be accessed in the same assembly or another assembly that reference it
    private: can ONLY be accessed from within the same class or struct
    protected: can ONLY be accessed from within the same class or struct, or the derived class
    internal: can only be accessed from within the same assembly
    protected internal: protected OR internal

  A class or struct member without access modifier will be PRIVATE by default
  A class or struct or interface without access modifier will be INTERNAL by default
  A interface member is ALWYAS public
  A delegate (when declared directly within a namespace) access modifier will be INTERNAL by default
  A delegate (when nested) access modifier will be PRIVATE by default

  Derived classes cannot have greater accessinility than their base type

Statics
  Use static members of a class without creating an instance of the class

Statistics
  Reduce complexity of app by adding classes
  Code snippet: ctor + Tab X 2
