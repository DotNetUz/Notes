VSTS vs TFS
  What is VSTS?
    VSTS based on TFS (~ TFS in the cloud)
  History of TFS
    Team Foundation Server 2005 replace SourceSafe
    TFS2005 has:
      Source Control
      Automated Build
      Project Management Tools
      Bug / Defect Tracking 
      Dashboards & Reports
        - SharePoint
        - SQL Server Reporting Services
      Needs Visual Studio 
    
    Team Fundation Server 2018:
      Source Control
        - TFVC
        - Git
      Automated Build (3rd v.)
      Automated Release (2nd v.)
      QA Testing & Defect Tracking: manage and run manual test cases
      Project Management tools:
        - Agile / Scrum
        - Kanban
        - Waterfall
        - CMMI
      Dashboard 
      Extensions & Integrations
      Almost anything move to Web

      TFS 2018 is cross-platform 
        - nearly all are browser-based
        - Visual Studio: Windows
        - Visual Studio Code: Windows, Mac OS, Linux
        - Visual Studio for Mac
        - Plug-in for Eclipse, IntelliJ, Android Studio
        - Xcode
        - Xamarin 
        - Corss-platform command line client 
        - Jenkins
        - Git

      TFS is package software - require delivery 
      VSTS has MicroSoft to:
        host Application
        serve as System Admin
        writes software
        applies patches 

Getting Started
  Creating Your First Project
    Requirements:
      MicroSoft Account (MSA)
      Visual Studio Team Searvices
    1. Login with MSA
    2. Pick domain name for XXX.visualstudio.command
    3. Pick code repo 
    4. pick region to host
    5. Load project page

  The Structure of Your Project + Demo of the Azure Portal
    Your new Project (a Team Project)
    Team Project: represented 1 software effort or 1 company
    i.e. collection of related stuff:
      Code version Control
      Project management 
      Build & Release tools
      (optional?) Testing & QA tools
      Wiki
      Dashboards for Reporting
    
    VSTS Account 
      is actually VSTS "tenant" in cloud
      In terms of TFS - this is team project collection (TPC)
        - a TPC can have many team Projects
      an account is the container of all these Projects 
    
    VSTS account vs. VSTS Project - one account holds many Projects

    To View VSTS account, use Azure protal (https://portal.azure.com)
    for following info:
      Subscription info
      User Types
      Users
      Billing & Licensing info
      Build & Deployment 
      Cloud-based load test
    
    Once login, look up "Team Searvices accounts" for more details
    Select a specific account attached to current MSA
      Essentials:
        location of data center 
        URL
        Status
      Under "Account Settings"
        Properties
        Users:
          Number of users available to add
        CI/CD
        Cloud based load testing 
    "Team Searvices accounts" is useful in troubleshooting for services or billing 

  User Types & Security in VSTS + Adding Users Using Microsoft Accounts
    Adding Users
      Two types:
        Microsoft Account (MSA) users - easier 
        Azure Active Directory (AAD) user 
          - orginational account (Org Id)
          - additional control 
    
    View security setup for VSTS Account
