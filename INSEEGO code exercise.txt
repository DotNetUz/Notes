INSEEGO code exercise

Instructions:
Write a basic test plan for the following scenario (use gherkin if you are comfortable
with gherkin)

Given
There are 2 Companies (companyV1 and companyV2) which are on 2 different versions
of the product V1 and V2.

The process of adding a product to Cart is different for the 2 versions. For V1, the user
chooses the product then the plan, for V2, it’s the other way around. Checkout is the
same.

Orders can only contain one product and one plan. They are defined by their orderId

Users can only place orders in one company and can only place a max of 3 orders

           
                           
Exercise:
Provide orders that adequately test your plan as a separate file.

Provide object structure data that fulfills all given requirements

Write code structures to validate a set of orders placed by User1 in Company1 and User2 in
Company2 and print the list of orders per user including the orderId as well as the product and
plan for each order

Please use your most proficient programming language to create object oriented design
to implement classes and methods . Please add comments describing any assumptions
you make

Must be completed in 2 days

Attach the results to a zip file (avoid naming it with the word “test” as it gets caught by
our spam filers). If you have a shared file location (google docs, etc) this also works
great.
