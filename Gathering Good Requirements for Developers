Gathering Good Requirements for Developers
Module 01: Requirements Gathering for Development
Introduction
Goals
  Common general goals: 
    performance scalibility 
    reiability 
    adaptability 
    cost-effectiveness 
  Correct system behaviors come from well-understood user requirements 
  Software requirements aim to create better understanding of the business

Audience
  developer 
    who needs requirement himself 
    who work with BA to get requirements done
  How does dev think about requirement process?
  What is the group size? 
  What kind of project and how much details are needed?
  
Methodology
  Requirement is both agile and waterfall
  The objective at the begining of a project is to get:
    Basic understanding
    Scope
    Sense of direction of project 
    List of things we will need
  so that we are aligned with what user want
  Make small course adjustment early on, then refine and iterate through SDLC 
  See from external that all of the work for requirements is done inside the process

  Two end of spectrum 
    agile: fluid use cases
    waterfall / waterfall-like: controlled and regid requirements

One vs. Many
  Write individual requirement / tools and deliverables
  vs. 
  Put requirements into larger package for specifications
