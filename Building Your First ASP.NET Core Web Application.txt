Demo: Taking a Look at the Finished Application

An Introduction to ASP.NET Core
  History:
    1996: Active Server Page (ASP)
      Serverside scripting
    2002: WebForms
      ViewState: generated to keep web stateful
        - Data generated and transfered with each request
      No control over HTML for dev
      Code behind: Hadr to test
      Page life cycle is hard to understand
    2008: ASP.NET MVC
      Released as open source
    2016: ASP.NET Core

  Issues with original ASP.NET MVC
    Dependency on IIS (System.Web):
    Dependency on .NET Framework
    Web evolves faster than .NET
    Created without Cloud in mind

  ASP.NET Core
    Built on .NET Core
    Cross-platform: Linux and Mac-Os
    not tied to .NET Framework

  Improvements:
    Unification b/t MVC and Web API
    Dependency Injection
    Modular HTTP request pipeline working with middle-ware
    Basedon NuGet (for package management)
    Cloud-ready (Azure)
    IIS or self-host
    Open Source & Cross Platform
