Module 1: Introduction
  Transact-SQL / T-SQL
    Create a table, work w/ columns and types 
    Changing data w/ INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE 
    Reading Data w/ SELECT
    Querying multiple tables w/ JOIN
    Arranging data w/ TOP, ORDER BY, OFFSET
    Analysis w/ Aggregates (SUM, COUNT, etc)
    Many to Many, Self-referencing Relationships
    Working w/ Strings and Dates
    SQL Server Express 2017 and SQL Server Management Studio is used for this note
    Install and connect to SQL Server locally 
    In SQL Server Management Studio, under local server, R-click on "Databases" to create new DB

Module 2: Working with Tables
  Creating / Droping a Table
    Select DB to add table under
      SQL: 
        create table Users(
          email varchar(50)
        );
      F5 / "Execute" to run this
      Message: Commands completed successfully.

      To see changes made by SQL query in UI, R-click under "Tables" to "Refresh" under Object Explorer 
      R-click "dbo.Users" and expend "Columns" to see "email (varchar(50), null)"

    To remove this table: 
      SQL: drop table Users;

  Primary Keys: Integer
    Primary Keys uniquely identify each row in a table - relational theory
    Create a table w/ primary keys
      SQL:
        create table Users(
          Id integer primary key
        );
      Columns: Id(PK, int, not null) with a key icon

      R-click "dbo.Users" and [Edit Top 200 Rows] and enter 1 for Id fields twice 
        - "Violation of PRIMARY KEY constraint" error
        - Primary Keys are unique

  Primary Keys: GUID
    Need to identify data outside of DB - an Enterprise-wide Id that is always unique in any settings, GUID 
    SQL:
      create table Users(
        Id uniqueidentifier primary key
      );
    Columns: Id(PK, uniqueidentifier, not null)
      PK: primary key
      uniqueidentifier: GUID

    in program, GUID can be generated via entity framework 
    
  Primary Keys: Auto-incrementing
    Useful for integer based key; Can laso be done for GUID
    SQL:
      create table Users(
        Id integer primary key identity(1,1), 
        email varchar(50)
      );
    Id: integer as primary key, starting from 1, increment by 1 for each new record 
    Open "Edit top 200 rows" twice to eliminate the UI error message when manually input email fields each time
    
  Tangent: Choosing a Primary Key
    Here is three types of primary keys
    create table Users {
      -- Id integer primary key identity(1, 1): Integer based primary key, auto-incremented by 1, starting from number 1 each time
      --     Integer is fast and small. However, there is max integer count (about 2 billion)      
      -- Id uniqueidentifier primary key default newid(): 
      --     A uniqueidentifier (GUID), auto-incrementing using newid() function, which generate GUID 
      --     Works well when there are not too many records in DB; GUID takes up more space
      --     Using newsequentialid() method (instead of newid()) to add new Id makes its easier to sort by indexer 
      -- email varchar(50) not null: string as primary key:
      --  email as primary key - CON: email generally has business value to application; 
      --  it helps identify user and communicate with user; but often changeable  

    }
    
  Composite Keys
    Using two fields together as composite primary key 
      create table Users(
        Id integer primary key identity(1, 1),
        email varchar(50)
        -- Autoincrement integer primary key
        -- start from 1, increase 1 each time 
      );

      create table Users_Roles(
        UserId integer,
        RoleId integer,
        primary key(UserId,RoleId)
        -- relationship b/t role and user is unique
        -- each combination (as primary key) can ONLY happen once
      );

      create table Roles(
        Id integer primary key identity(1, 1),
        Name varchar(50)
      );

  Defining Columns & Basic Column Constraints
    drop table Users;
    create table Users(
      Id integer primary key identity(1, 1),
      Email varchar(255) not null unique,
      -- varchar for alphanumeric characters
      -- nvarchar for UTF-8 support 
      MoneySpent decimal(10,2),
      -- decimal(length, precision)
      -- rounding will happen to 2nd decimal in this case
      CreatedAt datetime not null,
      First varchar(50),
      Last varchar(50),
      Bio varchar(MAX)
      -- if space is of conern, use varchar or varchar(MAX)
      -- if not, Bio text is OK too
    );

  Column Defaults
    drop table Users;
    create table Users(
      Id integer primary key identity(1, 1),
      Email varchar(255) not null unique,
      -- for unique entry there is no point for default value 
      -- this is the only field needed to create a new entry 
      MoneySpent decimal(10,2) default 0, 
      CreatedAt datetime not null default getdate(),
      -- getdate() returns current date
      First varchar(50),
      Last varchar(50),
      Bio varchar(MAX)
    );

  Naming Conventions
    Keywords are all CAPS in some convention 
    For fileds and tables' names camel casing can be used - some conventions use all lower or all upper case
    For primary key (in Users table), some convention opt to use UserId instead of Id
    - UserId may be easier to identify in a joined query
    Table name may be pluralized (Users) or singular (User) as a type
