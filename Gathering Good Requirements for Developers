Gathering Good Requirements for Developers
Module 00: Requirements Gathering for Development
Introduction
Goals
  Common general goals: 
    performance 
    scalibility 
    reiability 
    adaptability 
    cost-effectiveness 
  Correct system behaviors come from well-understood user requirements 
  Software requirements aim to create better understanding of the business

Audience
  developer 
    who needs requirement himself 
    who support / work with BA to get requirements done
  part-time BA with other duties, like project management 
  How does dev think about requirement process?
  What is the group size? 
  What kind of project and how much details are needed?
  
Methodology
  Waterfall Methodology:
    essential to get started right
    requirement skill are often lacking
    requirement often seen as barrier to get start 
  
  Agile Methodology:
    Requirements 
      some front work still required 
      seen as being done in cycle / iterative process
      often take the form of use cases / user stories
      considered very fluid
      starting as business objective, refine through process

  Requirement is both agile and waterfall
  The objective at the begining of a project is to get:
    Basic understanding
    Scope
    Sense of direction of project 
    List of things we will need
  so that we are aligned with what user want
  Make small course adjustment early on, then refine and iterate through SDLC 
  See from external that all of the work for requirements is done inside the process

  Two end of spectrum 
    agile: fluid use cases
    waterfall / waterfall-like: controlled and regid requirements

One vs. Many
  Write individual requirement / tools and deliverables
    Skills
    Techniques
  vs. 
  Put requirements into larger package for specifications 
    Tools
    Deliverables
    Managing relationships

  Module 2: The Big Picture
    software development 
    project lifecycles
    the roles, 
    who's in it, 
    what the requirement tools are in terms of deliverables and techniques
    stakeholders, who's involved, 
    we'll talk about the operating environment and 
    how you create an environment where people can be free to share requirements, 
    and we end with a time-cost-quality triangle.
