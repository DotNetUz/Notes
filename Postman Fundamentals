Postman Fundamentals
Module 1: Course Overview
  Making API request using different Environments
  Automated testing an API
  Scripting API workflows 
  Documenting an API

  Course goal: Maximize interactions w/ any APi

Module 2: Setting the Stage
  Setting the Stage
    Using Postman to interact w/ API
    API reach both front end and back end 
    
    Roles:
      App Dev - does not use API directly 
        - mock data when API is not quite ready yet
        - setup application without clicking through UI or enter data
      API dev - design & implement API
        - use Postman to test and document API
    
    Postman simplifies working with APIs

  Getting Started: Postman
    Use Postman to hit real API and get real data
    Install Postman via Chrome App store
      chrome://apps
      select webstore application
      search for Postman
      intsall Postman as Chrome application
      pro: install Postman on Mac & PC & Linux
    
    Install Postman as a stand alone application
      Load getpostman.com
      Download accordingly 

  Getting Started: API
    Get project to run locally
      Install Git, Node.js, PostgresSQL 
      Get project from https://github.com/taylonr/postman
      
  The Path Ahead
    Postman Basics: UI walk through - basic requests and API calls
    Testing Requests: Use Postman to Test API
    Collections: 
      Group similar API calls
      Combine collections and testing to script application
    Mock server: to return request
      For prototyping or working ahead of API development to prevent block
    Documentations:
      Postman helps w/ documentation on how API works
      
Module 3: Postman Basics
  Postman Basics
    Example scenario:
      Dependent features developed in parallel 
        Some required dependencies are not available during development 
        Postman can make request while application can develop feature of the same effect
    Postman use cases:
      Make basic API requests in different environments
      Other customization 
    Prerequisites: 
      Configure DB & initializing API
      command:
        Create DB:
          npm run db:create  
            This will create DB "postman_dev" with seed data
        Start API:
          npm run start:dev

  GETting Books
    Testing if API project is running on local 
      On browser URL, input "http://localhost:3000/landing"
      Browser should display "Pluralsight Sample API Running!"
    
    Working with API via Postman
      GET localhost:3000/Books
        Headers 
          Key: G-TOKEN Value: ROM831ESV
        Click [Send] blue button  
          Expected: 200 OK JSON response with "Time" and "Size" data
      
      GET localhost:3000/Books/1
        Expected:
          {
            "id": 1,
            "title": "Don't Waste Your Life",
            "author": "John Piper",
            "publicationDate": "2003-05-16",
            "isbn": "1593281056",
            "createdAt": "2018-10-17T23:33:16.413Z",
            "updatedAt": "2018-10-17T23:33:16.413Z"
          }    
      
      GET localhost:3000/Books/search
        Click [Params] button to add Key / Value pairs: "title" / "waste"
        Verify that correct query string is attached to URL: http://localhost:3000/Books/search?title=waste
        Expected:
          [
            {
              "id": 1,
              "title": "Don't Waste Your Life",
              "author": "John Piper"
            }
          ]
        Additional query parameters can be added in key / value table and query string will be updated accordingly 
        Multiple key / value pairs can be toggle on and off by the check boxes next to a specific pair
        - this is useful in managing numerous query parameters at the same time 

      Download request response 
        When all the url, header and query parameters are ready, instead of click blue [Send] button,
        click the drop down arrow next to it and select the option [Send and Download]
        and specify where to save the response 
        In this case, no response will be displayed, it is downloaded to local folder instead 

        This function is useful to mock out different responses and use it for coding reference 

  Adding a New Item to Inventory
    POST http://localhost:3000/Books
    Click [Body] tab below URL text field 
    Click radio button [raw]
    Input JSON in the text box under [raw]
    eg.
      {
        "title": "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
        "author": "Robert C. Martin",
        "isbn": "9780132350884",
        "release date": "2008-08-11"
      }
    Update additional header info:
      "Content-Type" / "application/json"
    Expected response:
      {
        "id": 5,
        "title": "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
        "author": "Robert C. Martin",
        "isbn": "9780132350884",
        "updatedAt": "2018-10-22T23:30:46.556Z",
        "createdAt": "2018-10-22T23:30:46.556Z",
        "publicationDate": null,
          "links": [
            {
              "rel": "self",
              "href": "http://localhost:3000/Books/5"
            }
          ]        
      }
    Inside the response, the href link can be also used in Postman 
    as GET http://localhost:3000/Books/5
    but Header info needs to be added again as Key: G-TOKEN Value: ROM831ESV
    Expected response:
    {
      "id": 5,
      "title": "Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship",
      "author": "Robert C. Martin",
      "publicationDate": null,
      "isbn": "9780132350884",
      "createdAt": "2018-10-22T23:27:56.501Z",
      "updatedAt": "2018-10-22T23:27:56.501Z"
    }

    The example above shows how to use header and body tabs as part of request
    Other options: 
       Authorization Menu Item can also be used as part of request 

  History
    Postman [History] pane on the left panel records previous requests
    Previous requests are grouped by the date; "Today" is on the top 
    Click each row / request to display the specific previous request 
    Old requests can be re-send this way

  Authorization
    DELETE http://localhost:3000/books/7 
    requires Authorization lest the API service returns 401 

    Click [Authorization] tab to expend drop down with multiple types of auth
    Select [Basic Auth] and enter "Username" and "Password" (both are "admin")
    Click [Update Request] and observe [Headers] count increased by 1 
    Select [Headers] tab and observe 
      a new "Authorization" header with 
      a value of "Basic" and then Base64 encoded string of admin and admin for username and password
    Click will result in 204 No Content, a success message - nothing to return when deleting something 

    GET http://localhost:3000/books/ now does not display deleted entry 

  Preset Headers
    Postman can track various settings of previous requests w/ preset headers
    Possible Headers
      Potentially a request may need numerous headres 
    Manage Headers by Presets:
      Select a previous request from History with commonly used Headers
      Click [Headers] / [Presets] / [Manage Presets]
      Click [Add] for a new group of Headers
      Enter "Header Preset Name", then input key / value pairs
      Click [Add] to create a new Preset
      
    The new Preset can now be used under a new tab:
      Input new URL
      Click [Headers] / [Presets] / [(Previously Created Preset Name)]
      Verify the key values pairs are now in Headers of current new request 
      
  Environments
    Different Headers for different environments - local, dev, test, prod, etc...
    Create dev and test environments with following commands:
      npm run start:dev
      npm run start:test
    Verify that each API services listening on its own port number:
      dev:  3000
      test: 3030
      - making changes to different routes and setting can be tedious 
    Add new environment (variables):
      Click gear wheel icon on top right to open "MANAGE ENVIRONMENTS"
      Click [Add] button to add a new enviornment via "Add Environment Pane"
      Input environment name like dev 
      Add variable like "host" with value "localhost:3030"
    Use enviornment: 
      Use top right drop down to select environment 
      GET http://localhost:3030/books/ referencing host variable in dev environment
      URL input: http://{{host}}/books
      Environment can be switched by top right drop down without explictly define host variable 
    Duplicate enviornment:
      To cover multiple enviornments with similar variables,
      create an initial environment with complete set of variables
      Click the duplicate icon in "MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTS" modal for a copy of environment 
      Edit environment name and update variables' values accordingly 
    Download environment:
      Click the download icon in "MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTS" modal for a copy of environment 
      Download enviornment variables as JSON file 
      Eg. 
        {
	        "id": "d931485c-24f1-46b1-acf9-43abfad0b923",
	        "name": "Dev",
	        "values": [
            {
              "key": "host",
              "value": "localhost:3030",
              "description": "",
              "enabled": true
            }
          ],
          "_postman_variable_scope": "environment",
          "_postman_exported_at": "2018-10-24T01:36:02.772Z",
          "_postman_exported_using": "Postman/6.4.4"
        }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
    Import environment:
      Click the [Import] button in the bottom of "MANAGEMENT ENVIRONMENTS" pane
      Then select file 

  Import
    Capture API request sent from UI by Postman for debugging or modification:
    1. Record API request from UI via Browser DevTool > Network (tab)
    2. R-Click on the request to capture 
    3. Use the option Copy > Copy as cURL (bash) 
    4. Open Postman > [Import] (button on top)
    5. Select option "Paste Raw Text" and paste cURL into the empty text pad below
    6. Click [Import] button
    7. Verify the request is duplicated in Postman ready to be sent or modified or debug or data-driven test
    
  Proxy
    Another way to capture API request by proxy 
    1. Click Postman button on top row with tooltip "Capture API requests with Postman"
       to open modal titled "PROXY SETTINGS"
    2. Click "Connect" button to capture API request; Verify and record "Port" value on pane
    3. Look up IP address of local machine 
    4. On device to monitor, add local machine IP, with port number specified on Postman, as a proxy  
    5. Browse to specific web site or use APP from monitored device 
    6. Verify HTTP requests registered in History (default storage) 

  Generating Code
    Create code snippet to access Web API (like in an AJAX call)
    1. Select from History the request to make in code 
    2. Under the url field, select "Code" to open "GENERATE CODE SNIPPETS" modal
    3. Select "javascript jquery AJAX"
    4. Adjust code generated as needed:
       For example, make changes to settings.data to emulate user input from form
       by pasting this code into an HTML for test harness   

  Sync
    Sync information across multiple instances of Postman 
    1. Click [Sign in] button
    2. Sign in with username and password or sign in w/ google
    3. Once sign in, Postman will sync across multiple browsers with same 
       requests, header presets, environments, environmental variables and other features   

  Summary
    Make verb based requests: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
    Manipulate headers
    Authorize request
    Send data in with request body
    Track Requests
    Capture & duplicate / modify tracked requests
    Setup different environment for different variables like host in request URL

Module 4: Testing Requests
  Testing Requests
    Test API
    Create regression test to run before API deployment 
    Programmatically interact with API via collections 

  Meet the API Team
    Test entire request life cycle from request to response 
    Build library to run cutomnized test
    CD / CI integration for regression test 
    
  Pre-built Tests
    Start w/ create and send a request in Postman 
    Select [Tests] tab under URL field 
    Select one of the snippets from right pane as starting template 
    Click [Send] to re-send a request and run test after response 
    Verify test results by selecting "Test Results" tab below

  Test Syntax
    Eg. 
      pm.test("Status code is 200", function() {
        pm.response.to.have.status(200);
      });

      pm: object to provide everthing required for creating test
      test: 
        function takes two parameters: 
          1. test name as string that describe the test  
          2. function to be executed for the test, takes no property, verify passing condition   
      response: object represents data retuned from API

    pm property "info" contains infomation about the script that is being executed, such as request ID
    pm property "global" 
    pm property "environment" 

    For assertions:
      have.status
      have.header
      have.body
      have.jsonBody

    For more reference: www.getpostman.com/docs/      
    Look for "Scripts" section

  Basic Tests
    Verify the number of books in the JSON response from  
      pm.test("Return 21 books", function() {
        const books = pm.response.json();
        pm.expect(books.length).to.eql(21);
      });

    Check if every book has title 
      pm.test("Every book should have title", () => {
        const books = pm.response.json();
        pm.expect(books.every(
          book => {
            return book.title !== undefined;
          }
        )).to.be.true;
      });
    
    Refactor previous test
      const titleIsDefined = (book) => {
        return book.title !== undefined;
      }
      pm.test("Every book should have title", () => {
        const books = pm.response.json();
        pm.expect(books.every(titleIsDefined)).to.be.true;
      });

  Using Other Libraries
    To interact with Date and Time, like "Create date is equal to today"
      const moment = require('moment');
      pm.test("Create date is equal to today", () => {
        const data = pm.response.json();

        pm.expect(moment(data.createdAt).format('MM/DD/YYYY'))
          .to.eql(moment().format('MM/DD/YYYY'));
      });


    Lodash is available via a global underscore, '_'
    eg. 
      const books = pm.response.json();
    can be re-written as following: 
      const books = _.result(pm, 'response.json');
      // look for 'response.json' function within pm, and execute the function when found 
    
    Other libaraies can be accessed via require function, such as: const moment = require('moment');
      atob → v2.0.3
      btoa → v1.1.2
      chai → v3.5.0
      cheerio → v0.22.0
      crypto-js → v3.1.9-1
      csv-parse/lib/sync → 1.2.1
      lodash → v4.17.4 (when used with require, the inbuilt _ object is for v3.10.1)
      moment → v2.18.1 (sans locales)
      postman-collection → v1.2.0
      tv4 → v1.2.7
      uuid → (the module loaded is a shim for original module)
      xml2js → 0.4.19

    A number of NodeJS modules are also available:
      path
      assert
      buffer
      util
      url
      punycode
      querystring
      string_decoder
      stream
      timers
      events

  Summary
    Pre-Built Tests for simple scenarios
    Custom Built Tests on the request or response
    Import libraries (if available)

Module 5: Collections
  Collections
    Save requests into collections & Use collections w/in Postman
  Using Tests on the Front End
    Automate API requests to setup test
  Creating Collections
    Open Postman > New tab
    Creat following request: POST http://localhost:3000/households
      with previous Headers Key / Value pair from Preset
    Body > Select "Raw" radio button 
      > Create one JSON object and set "name" property for household name
      > [Send] request
    Keep track of response value of "id" for future request 

    Click [Save] nect to [Send] to open modal "SAVE REQUEST"
    Add new collection by Clicking [Create Collection] 
    Input name for the new collection > Click Checkbox > Click [Save to {collection name}]
    Verify "Collections" tab is selected then Close extended side panel 

  Add more requests:
    For "Create a user" request
      Open a new tab > Select [POST] with URL: http://localhost:3000/users
      Select [Body] tab > [Raw] radio button > input following JSON & Send request
        {
          "email": "test01@test.com",
          "firstName": "First",
          "lastName": "User",
          "householdId": 1
        }
      Response:
        {
          "id": 1,
          "email": "test01@test.com",
          "firstName": "First",
          "lastName": "User",
          "householdId": 1,
          "wishlistId": 1,
          "updatedAt": "2018-10-27T01:36:46.226Z",
          "createdAt": "2018-10-27T01:36:46.226Z",
          "links": [
              {
                  "rel": "self",
                  "href": "http://localhost:3000/users/1"
              }
          ]
        }
      
      User created with a auto-generated wishlist, "householdId": 1
      Save request as "Create User" to "Household Wishlists" collection  
    
    For "Add book to wishlist":
      Open a new tab > Select [POST] with URL: http://localhost:3000/whishlists/{wishlistId}/books/{bookId}
      No body for this request- just add book 1 to wishlist 1
      Save the request 
    
    For "Get all books from a household":
      GET http://localhost:3000/households/1/wishlistBooks with Header preset 

    Duplicate and Rename requests in collection for creating second user and adding book for seoncd user 

  Collection Runner
    Use collection to start a repeatable process
      To open collection runner:
        Mouse hover the collection to run
        Click arrow button to open second pane
        Click the [Run] button 
      To run this collection, click the button below, [Run Household Wishlist]

    After collection run, verify users with GET http://localhost:3000/users
    For duplicated entry with unique wishlistId: 
      verify books under that wishlist with GET http://localhost:3000/wishlists/5/books   
      (if the wishlistId of the entry is 5)
      While the wishlist has "name" and "id", its "books" property is an empty array
      As for wishlistId 1 and 2, there is only one book for each of them b/c API will not add the same book in same wishlist

  Using Variables
    Use Postman to programmatically update request so data's setup correctly 
    1. Go to Household Wishlists and select "Create Household" request and send it
    2. Within JSON response of "Create Household" request, there is an id property, like "id": 4 
       Every user requires a household
    3. Open "Test" tab and look for snippet for "Set a global variable"
    4. Modify the default variables and values to the following: 
        pm.globals.set("householdId", pm.response.json().id);
       This will set the value of property "id" of next json response to variable "householdId" in global scope
       (Save request first) 
    5. Verify the variable "householdId" and its value with "Enviornment Quick Look" icon
       
    To use variable "householdId" in global scope:
    1. Replace hardcoded value of "householdId" in subsequenct requests' body with {{householdId}}
       "householdId": {{householdId}} 
    
    Create global variable for each of the users' wishlist Id from response of POST request that create user
    For each POST request, set wishlistId property in JSON response to be the value of new global variable 
    Such as: 
      pm.globals.set("firstWishlistId", pm.response.json().wishlistId); 

    For POST request to add a book, the request can be configured to take whislist Id dynamiclly:
      http://{{host}}/wishlists/{{firstWishlistId}}/books/1 
    
    For GET request to get household book, the request can be configured to take household dynamiclly
      http://{{host}}/households/{{householdId}}/wishlistBooks

    Once the collection is run again, click on the resulting URL to observe that
    response body now contains two books - one from each user   

    Environment variables can be toggled from "Collection Runner" tab at top from the results panel
    
  Pre-request Scripts
    [Pre-Request Scripts] -> [Request] -> [Response] -> [Test] 
    Pre-Request Scripts sets up data for Requests or Test
    Eg. Create random name and email address to be used as user info
      // Under Pre-request Script
      const users = [{
        email:"RU01@test.com",
        firstName: "Arya",
        lastname: "Stark"
        }, {
        email:"RU02@test.com",
        firstName: "John",
        lastname: "Snow"
        }, {
        email:"RU03@test.com",
        firstName: "Brynden",
        lastname: "Rivers"
        }, {
        email:"RU04@test.com",
        firstName: "Tyrion",
        lastname: "Lannister"
      }];

      const user = _.sample(users); // draw random user form users

      pm.globals.set("email", user.email);
      pm.globals.set("firstName", user.firstName);
      pm.globals.set("lastName", user.lastName);

    Update body of Request POST http://{{host}}/users referencing global variables 
      {
        "email": {{email}},
        "firstName": {{firstName}},
        "lastName": {{lastName}},
        "householdId": {{householdId}} 
      }   

  Data Files
    Hardcode test data makes update difficult - use data files to bypass this
