  Introduction
    Course outline
      Mocha
      Chai for assert
      Sinon for mocking
      Combination 
      Edge cases
      Istanbul for code coverage 

    In this module:
      Definitions: Unit / Integration / Functional test

    Fast changes with Node - how to adjust

  Types of Testing
    Unit test  
      Test just smallest available piece
      Mock everything else (with Sinon) 
      Functional Test
        Ex. 
          // ['admin', 'user'], 'admin'
          function isAuthorized(neededRole) {
            return roles.indexOf(neededRole) >= 0;
          }
      
    Integration test
      Mock external resources: Sinon & Stubs
    
    Functional test
      AKA End tot End / Black Box test
        Everything works together
  
  Node Versions
    Aggressive release cycle
    NVM - uses different versions of Node
      creationix/nvm from github
      command: which node 
        - identify current installed node version
      command: nvm install 7.9 
        - install node version 7.9
      command: nvm use --lts
        - use current LTS version of Node
      This course will use version 6.10 (LTS at the time)
